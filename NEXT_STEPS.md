# 🚀 Launching WIDAMA Pharmacy

The rebranding to **WIDAMA Pharmacy** is complete and the app is ready!

## 1. Install Dependencies
✅ **Done!** I have successfully installed all dependencies.

## 2. Start the App
Run the local development server to view the site:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Access the site at: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## 3. Final Configuration
- **Environment Variables**: Open `.env.local` and add your real API keys (`RESEND_API_KEY`, etc.).
- **Logo**: Replace `public/logo.png` with your official WIDAMA Pharmacy logo.

## 4. Deployment
When ready to deploy:
```bash
npm run build
```

## Troubleshooting
If you see `ENOSPC` errors again, you need to free more disk space.
